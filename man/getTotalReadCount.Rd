\title{Compute Total Mapped Reads for Canonical Chromosomes}
\usage{
getTotalReadCount(BamFile)
}
\arguments{
\item{BamFile}{Character. Path to a BAM file.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value representing the total number of reads mapped
  to chromosomes chr1 through chr22.
}
\description{
This function calculates the total number of mapped reads in a BAM file,
restricted to canonical chromosomes (chr1â€“chr22).
}
\details{
This function uses \code{idxstatsBam()} to obtain alignment statistics
for all reference sequences in the BAM file, then filters to autosomes
and returns the sum of mapped reads.

\examples{
\dontrun{
total_reads <- getTotalReadCount("example.bam")
}
