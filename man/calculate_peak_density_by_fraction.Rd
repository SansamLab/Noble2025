\title{Calculate Peak Density by Replication Timing Fraction}
\usage{
calculate_peak_density_by_fraction(repliseq_gr, peak_gr)
}
\arguments{
\item{repliseq_gr}{A \code{GRanges} object containing replication timing windows with 16 S phase fractions.}

\item{peak_gr}{A \code{GRanges} object containing genomic regions such as peaks.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with one row per replication timing fraction and the following columns:
\itemize{
  \item \code{S.fraction}: Fraction label (S1–S16)
  \item \code{bp}: Total base pairs in that S fraction
  \item \code{peakCount}: Total number of peaks overlapping the S fraction
  \item \code{meanPeakCount}: Mean number of peaks per 50kb window in the S fraction
  \item \code{peakDensity}: Normalized peak density (peaks per 50 kb)
  \item \code{S.fraction.numeric}: Numeric version of the S fraction (1–16)
}
}
\description{
Computes the density of peaks (overlaps) in each replication timing fraction
based on overlap with a set of peaks (e.g., ChIP or origin peaks). Peak density
is normalized per 50 kb.
