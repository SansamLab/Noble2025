\title{Generate a coverage ribbon plot from a deepTools matrix file}
\usage{
makeCoverageRibbonPlot(
  matrix_file,
  group_filter_pattern,
  group_colors,
  group_line_type,
  plot_title = "Coverage Plot",
  group_labels = NULL,
  group_title_extraction_fun = function(x) gsub("_rep.*", "", x),
  x_axis_breaks = c(0, 300, 600),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrix_file}{Character string. Path to the input deepTools matrix file (gzipped).}

\item{group_filter_pattern}{Character string. Regex pattern to filter groups (e.g., "TICRR").}

\item{group_colors}{Named character vector of colors for the fill aesthetic, with names matching groups.}

\item{group_line_type}{Named character vector of line types for the fill aesthetic, with names matching groups.}

\item{plot_title}{Character string. Title to display on the plot.}

\item{group_labels}{Optional named character vector. Names are group IDs and values are display labels.}

\item{group_title_extraction_fun}{Function applied to each sample name to extract the group label.
Default: \code{function(x) gsub("_rep.*", "", x)}.}

\item{x_axis_breaks}{Numeric vector for x-axis tick positions. Default: \code{c(0, 300, 600)}.}

\item{x_axis_labels}{Character vector for x-axis labels. Default: \code{c("-3kb", "summit", "+3kb")}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot2} object showing a ribbon plot of group-wise median coverage with min/max shading.
}
\description{
This function reads a deepTools matrix file (e.g., from computeMatrix), converts it to an
enriched heatmap matrix, computes per-group median signal and range (min/max), and generates
a ribbon plot showing the average profile with variability.
