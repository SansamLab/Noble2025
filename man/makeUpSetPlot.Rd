\title{Generate an UpSet plot of reproducible and replicate peaks}
\usage{
makeUpSetPlot(
  reproduciblePeaksPath = "../MakeReproduciblePeaks/MTBP_Peaks_Reproducible_6.narrowPeak",
  replicatePeakPaths = paste0("../01_Asynchronous_HCT116/results/macs2_normalPeaks/",
    asynchronousPeakFiles[grep("MTBP", asynchronousPeakFiles)]),
  replicateLabels = c("1:1000 1", "1:1000 2", "1:1000 3", "1:250 1", "1:250 2",
    "1:250 3")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{reproduciblePeaksPath}{Character string. File path to a BED file of reproducible peaks.}

\item{replicatePeakPaths}{Character vector. File paths to BED files containing peak calls for each replicate.}

\item{replicateLabels}{Character vector. Display labels for the replicate peak sets (must match order of paths).}
}
\value{
A list object generated by \code{UpSetR::upset()}, representing the UpSet plot.
}
\description{
This function creates an UpSet plot showing the intersection between a set of reproducible peaks
and multiple replicate peak sets. It pads replicate peak lists with dummy values to ensure that
the set size bars in the UpSet plot accurately reflect the total number of peaks in each replicate.
The final plot includes only reproducible peaks in the intersection matrix but uses the accurate set size bars.

  replicatePeakPaths = c("rep1.bed", "rep2.bed", "rep3.bed"),
