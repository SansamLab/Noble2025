\title{Generate an Euler Plot Showing Peak Overlaps from Multiple BED Files}
\usage{
make_euler_plot_showing_peak_overlaps(peaks_bed_paths_list, colors_vector)
}
\arguments{
\item{peaks_bed_paths_list}{A named list of file paths to BED files, where each represents a peak set.}

\item{colors_vector}{A vector of colors to use for the Euler plot.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object representing the Euler plot of peak overlaps.
}
\description{
This function reads multiple BED files, defines a unified reference peak set,
determines peak overlaps, and creates an Euler plot.
}
\examples{
peaks_bed_files <- list(
  "sample1" = "path/to/sample1.bed",
  "sample2" = "path/to/sample2.bed"
)
colors <- c("#1b9e77", "#d95f02")
euler_plot <- make_euler_plot_showing_peak_overlaps(peaks_bed_files, colors)
print(euler_plot)
